Analysis of CWRU Student Course EvaluationsBenjamin Kaplan and Stephen Johnson	Every semester, students at Case are asked to evaluate their classes. This provides a huge wealth of information but it is fairly useless it its raw form. For our analysis, we are utilizing all course evaluations submitted for undergraduate courses at Case Western from the fall of 1997 through the spring of 2006.  Although the surveys are voluntary, subjecting them to selection bias, they have a high response rate. We used a custom script (written in Python) to parse the data.

We observed several things with this wealth of data (we had over 11,000 data points). First of all, we know, with a confidence level of 99.9%, that classes for the college of arts and sciences rate higher than classes for the school of engineering. Using the scale where 0= poor and 4 = Excellent with the other variables in between, the 1548 classes in the School of Engineering received an average rating of 2.56, with a standard deviation of .63652. The 6083 classes in the College of Arts and Sciences had an average rating of 2.91 with a standard deviation of 0.65858.
