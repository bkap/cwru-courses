Analysis of CWRU Student Course Evaluations
Benjamin Kaplan and Stephen Johnson

Every semester, students at Case are asked to evaluate their classes. This provides a huge wealth of information but it is fairly useless it its raw form. For our analysis, we are utilizing all course evaluations submitted for undergraduate courses at Case Western from the fall of 1997 through the spring of 2006.  Although the surveys are voluntary, subjecting them to selection bias, they have a high response rate. We used a custom script (written in Python) to parse the data.

We observed several things with this wealth of data (we had over 9,000 data points). First of all, we know, with a confidence level of 99.9%, that classes for the college of arts and sciences rate higher than classes for the school of engineering. Using the scale where 0= poor and 4 = Excellent with the other variables in between, the 1595 classes in the School of Engineering received an average rating of 2.56, with a standard deviation of .63701. The 6510 classes in the College of Arts and Sciences had an average rating of 2.92 with a standard deviation of 0.65572. Using a 2-sample Student's T distribution gave a T score of about -20, which corresponds to a probability of less than .000001. In addition, an analysis of course difficulty shows that students consider engineering classes to be harder than Arts and Sciences classes. The engineering classes had an average difficulty score of 2.28 ± 0.54851 while the arts and sciences classes had an average difficulty of 2.05123 ± 0.52131.

Another comparison we looked at was the Sages courses vs. other courses at the school. The 466 Sages classes in the dataset had an average course ranking of 2.380 ± 0.803. The other classes 8969 classes had an average ranking of 2.855 ± 0.655.
