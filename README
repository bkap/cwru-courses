To generate the figures, you need to run rating_vs_standing.py,
rating_vs_workload.py, and workload_vs_standing.py. Those generate the 3
graphs, with regression lines, containing all 8000 datapoints. All of the
figures showing trends over time are generated by running
averages_over_time.py.

To get the results of the 2-sample T-tests comparing the School of Engineering
and the College of Arts and Sciences, run dept_ratings.py.

To run these files, you'll need Python 2 installed on your computer. It has
only been tested on 2.5 and 2.6 on OS X, but it may work on 2.4 and 2.3 and on
other platforms as well.
Python is preinstalled on Mac OS X and most Linux distributions. 
To get Python for Windows, you can download it for free from http://www.python.org

These files also depends on the numpy and scipy libraries, which can be
downloaded from http://scipy.org and matplotlib, which can
be downloaded from http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net


The original data we processed (repaired for the most part) can be found in the
raw_data/ folder in a human. The extracted data is stored in evals.pickle and
can be read with Python's pickle module. All of the generated figures are
stored as PDFs in paper/figures/. The TeX version of our report as well as the
generated PDF are located in paper/.
